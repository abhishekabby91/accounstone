## Resolved: Accounting Services blog/guide pair — merged

`/blog/outsourced-accounting-services` and `/resources/guides/outsourced-accounting-services-guide` overlapped at the paragraph level, not just the topic level (near-identical "what accounting operations covers" list, month-end close checklist, and GAAP/FRS 102/AASB summary). Flagged in the growth-system audit as needing an owner decision between merging or deepening/differentiating; the owner chose **merge**.

**Executed 2026-08-21:** The guide (`/resources/guides/outsourced-accounting-services-guide`) is the surviving URL — it was already the deeper, more technical page. Before removing the blog, its one genuinely unique section ("Cost Ranges" — the guide had no cost content at all) was ported into the guide as a new "What Does It Cost?" section, so no informational content was lost. `app/blog/outsourced-accounting-services/` was then deleted, and a permanent 301 redirect from `/blog/outsourced-accounting-services` to the guide was added in `next.config.mjs`. All internal links, the `/blog` listing, and `app/sitemap.ts` were updated to stop referencing the retired URL.

## Resolved gap: UK/AU payroll, AP, AR pages

The Growth System Audit (2026-08-21, §06) flagged that payroll, AP, and AR had no dedicated UK/AU pages while bookkeeping, tax preparation, and audit support did. Closed the same day: added `/services/payroll/{united-kingdom,australia}`, `/services/accounts-payable/{united-kingdom,australia}`, and `/services/accounts-receivable/{united-kingdom,australia}` — each with genuine regional detail (RTI/PAYE/NI/auto-enrolment and STP/superannuation/PAYG for payroll; input VAT/MTD/CIS and GST/ABN/RCTI for AP; GBP/VAT and AUD/GST invoicing for AR), not a find-and-replace of the U.S. page. Navbar, sitemap, and both market pages' service grids updated to point at the new pages instead of falling back to the generic overview. `/services/accounting` remains U.S.-only by design — no UK/AU page exists yet, and none was claimed in the navbar or market pages.

## Resolved gap: engagement-model comparison

Closed 2026-08-21: added `/resources/guides/choosing-an-engagement-model`, comparing the four `/solutions/*` pages (offshore accounting support, staff augmentation, dedicated accounting teams, back-office support) side by side — unit of engagement, best fit, typical duration — plus a decision framework and an honest note that the models blur in practice rather than presenting them as four rigid tiers. Cross-linked from all four solutions pages, the solutions index, and the "how to choose a partner" guide (which covers evaluating a provider generally, not choosing between models — kept distinct rather than merged).
