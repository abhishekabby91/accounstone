    items: [
      { h: 'Source documents are usually the real bottleneck', p: 'Transactions cannot be coded correctly from a bank feed alone. A card charge shows an amount and a merchant, not what was bought or which entity it belonged to. Where receipts and invoices arrive late or not at all, the ledger fills with plausible guesses that someone has to unpick at year end. Fixing document flow first usually does more for accuracy than any change to the posting process.' },
      { h: 'A chart of accounts compounds its own mistakes', p: 'A chart that grew by accretion — a new account each time something did not fit — produces reports nobody trusts. In the U.S. this bites hardest on multi-state activity: if revenue is not separable by state, the nexus picture cannot be assembled without rebuilding history. Getting the structure right is cheap early and expensive later.' },
      { h: 'Review is part of the process, not an audit of it', p: 'Every engagement has a named preparer and a named reviewer, with the review point agreed before work starts. The reviewer is looking at exceptions and judgement items, not re-performing the posting. Without that split, either everything gets checked twice or nothing gets checked at all.' },
      { h: 'The first month is not the steady state', p: 'Onboarding usually involves cleanup: unreconciled periods, an opening balance that does not agree, historical coding that has to be understood before it can be continued. That work is scoped separately from the recurring engagement, because pricing it as though it were routine misleads everyone.' },
      { h: 'Cost is driven by volume and mess, not by headcount', p: 'What moves the number is transaction volume, the number of accounts and entities, how many bank and card feeds have to reconcile, the state of the opening position, and turnaround expectations.

    items: [
      { h: 'The digital link is what usually breaks', p: 'MTD requires an unbroken digital path from the underlying record to the submitted figure. The break is rarely dramatic: someone exports to a spreadsheet, adjusts a total, and types the result into the return. Keeping the work inside the accounting system rather than around it is most of what compliance actually requires.' },
      { h: 'VAT coding has to be right at entry, not at quarter end', p: 'Standard-rated, zero-rated, exempt and outside-the-scope supplies each behave differently, and reverse charge adds another layer for construction and cross-border services. Correcting coding during the quarter is routine; reconstructing it during the return week is not.' },

      { h: 'The control account has to be reconciled during the year', p: 'Reconciling GST control accounts only at year end means discovering twelve months of drift at the point when there is least time to investigate it. Doing it each BAS period turns a forensic exercise into a short check.' },

    title: 'The Preparation Work Behind a U.S. Audit File',
    intro: 'A U.S. audit rarely stalls on technical accounting. It stalls on the distance between the PBC list and the state of the file.',
    items: [
      { h: 'Lead schedules that agree to the trial balance', p: 'Balance sheet lead schedules built from the general ledger, cast and agreed, with movements explained rather than left for the audit team to derive from the detail.' },
      { h: 'Year-end reconciliations finished first', p: 'Bank, receivable, payable, accrual, prepaid and intercompany reconciliations completed and supported before the request list arrives, so fieldwork is not spent waiting.' },
      { h: 'The PBC list worked as a checklist', p: 'Prepared-by-client requests tracked item by item with a visible status, so open items are known throughout rather than discovered at the end of fieldwork.' },
      { h: 'Sample support pulled and indexed', p: 'Invoices, contracts and supporting documents retrieved against the auditor’s selections and indexed to the reference they asked for, rather than delivered as an undifferentiated folder.' },
      { h: 'Disclosure support under U.S. GAAP', p: 'Underlying analysis for the footnotes — related parties, commitments, leases, revenue disaggregation under ASC 606 — prepared for your CPA to review and finalise.' },
      { h: 'The line that does not move', p: 'Every item above is preparation performed for the company. The engaged auditor designs the procedures, selects the samples, evaluates the evidence and issues the opinion.' },
    ],
