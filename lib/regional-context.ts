    paragraphs: [
      "The books are usually not the problem. The problem is what the reviewer finds when they open them: a suspense account that has been growing quietly, a run of card transactions coded to the wrong entity, an owner draw sitting in operating expenses. None of it is difficult. All of it takes a senior person an afternoon to unpick, and that afternoon repeats every month.",
      "So the useful question is not whether bookkeeping can be handed over. It is whether the handoff leaves your reviewer with less work than before. That depends almost entirely on how exceptions are handled. When a transaction cannot be coded from the bank feed alone, the choice is to guess or to ask. Guessing produces a clean-looking ledger and a bad month-end. We ask, and we put the open items in one place instead of scattering them through the ledger.",
      "For a business operating in more than one state, the same discipline decides whether the state picture is visible or has to be reconstructed later. Revenue and activity tracked by state as it is posted is a routine habit. Rebuilding it after twelve months is a project.",

    paragraphs: [
      "The pattern is recognisable: the ledger drifts for two months, then the quarter ends and someone spends a week getting it into a state where the return can be prepared. The work is not hard, but it is compressed, and it happens four times a year whether or not anyone has capacity for it.",
      "Under Making Tax Digital the cost of that drift went up, because the ledger is no longer just an internal record. It is the substantiation behind a figure that has been submitted. A transaction coded standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated is no longer a tidy-up item; it is a correction with a trail. Getting the coding right in the week it happens is a different job from getting it right in the week the return is due.",
      "None of that changes who decides. Your accountant keeps the VAT scheme decisions, any treatment that is genuinely arguable, and the submission itself. What moves is the recurring preparation underneath: posting, reconciling, chasing the invoice that the bank feed cannot replace, and keeping the digital record intact so nothing has to be re-keyed.",

    paragraphs: [
      "A mis-coded transaction in Australia does not announce itself. It sits in the ledger looking ordinary, flows into the BAS, and stays there until someone reconciles the GST control account against what was actually reported. If that only happens at year end, the reconciliation stops being a check and becomes an investigation, usually in the same weeks as everything else.",
      "The distinctions that cause it are not exotic. GST-free, input-taxed and taxable supplies each behave differently, and the line is not always obvious in food, health, education or financial supplies. A bank feed cannot tell you which applies, and it cannot tell you whether the supplier was registered for GST at all. Without the tax invoice, the credit is not supported no matter how the entry looks.",
      "So the recurring work is worth doing properly at the point of entry rather than at the point of lodgment. Your registered BAS or tax agent keeps the lodgment and any question of treatment. What we keep current is the ledger they rely on, with GST control reconciled each period rather than once a year.",

Not a checklist as a document that exists, but as the thing the work actually runs on: each recurring task with an owner, a position in the sequence, and a due day relative to period end.

Year-end close, the June quarter BAS, superannuation for the quarter, and the start of the audit or tax preparation queue all arrive within weeks of each other, and they arrive for the same small team every year.",
      "What decides how that period goes is almost entirely what happened before it. If GST control accounts were reconciled each period, June is a check. If clearing accounts were agreed as they went, the opening position is known. If neither happened, the same weeks now carry the reconciliation work that was deferred, and it is being done at the point of least available time.",

It is the organising: chasing the document that never arrived, building the workpaper, tying the schedule, and then doing it again for the next return.",

A return arrives prepared but with the workpapers assembled afterwards to justify what was entered, and the reviewer ends up reconstructing the preparation to trust it.
