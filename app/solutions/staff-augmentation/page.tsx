  { question: 'What is accounting staff augmentation?', answer: 'Staff augmentation adds accounting professionals to your existing workflow for a defined period or ongoing need. It can be useful when work increases faster than hiring, a specialist is needed for a project, or your team needs temporary capacity without changing who owns review and approvals.' },
  { question: 'What work can augmented accounting staff handle?', answer: 'The scope can include bookkeeping, reconciliations, AP/AR, month-end close support, tax preparation tasks, audit support, reporting preparation, cleanup, and other defined accounting workflows. The exact responsibilities are agreed before onboarding.' },
  { question: 'How quickly can a team member start?', answer: 'The timeline depends on the role, availability, systems, documentation, and knowledge-transfer requirements. Rather than promise a universal start date, we scope the requirement first and confirm a realistic onboarding timeline.' },
  { question: 'Can augmented staff work in our existing systems?', answer: 'Yes. The model is designed to work inside your established accounting software, procedures, communication channels, and approval structure. The objective is to add capacity without forcing a separate operating process.' },
  { question: 'Does staff augmentation mean we lose control of the work?', answer: 'No. Your team can retain responsibility for approvals, accounting judgments, client communication, and final review. The augmented professional handles the defined preparation or operational work and flags exceptions according to the agreed workflow.' },
  { question: 'Is there a minimum commitment?', answer: 'The appropriate engagement length depends on the work. Support can be structured around a project, a busy period, a recurring workflow, or an ongoing capacity requirement. The proposal should match the actual workload rather than force every client into the same term.' },
  { question: 'Can an augmented team member eventually be hired permanently?', answer: 'That depends on the engagement terms and the circumstances of both organizations. If a long-term hiring path is important, it should be discussed before the engagement so the commercial and transition terms are clear.' },

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed">Staff augmentation gets used loosely enough that two firms can agree to it and mean different arrangements. The distinction that matters is who directs the work.</p>
              <h3 className="font-bold text-primary text-lg pt-2">Augmentation</h3>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed">You direct the work. We supply the capacity. The person works inside your systems, to your checklist, against your review points, and their output arrives in your queue looking like your team&rsquo;s output. You decide what gets done and in what order, day to day.</p>
              <h3 className="font-bold text-primary text-lg pt-2">A managed function</h3>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed">The provider directs the work and owns a defined outcome &mdash; a closed month, a clean payables queue &mdash; against an agreed standard. You review the result rather than the sequence. That is a different arrangement, and usually a better one where the process is stable and repetitive.</p>
              <h3 className="font-bold text-primary text-lg pt-2">A dedicated team</h3>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed">A standing group working only your portfolio, with its own rhythm and a single point of contact. Closer to augmentation in who directs it, closer to a managed function in how it is staffed and how the knowledge accumulates.</p>

                  <p className="text-xs font-bold uppercase tracking-wider text-accent">When augmentation is the wrong answer</p>
                  <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed text-foreground">Augmentation adds hands to an existing process. Where the process is genuinely documented &mdash; checklists, conventions, worked examples, known exceptions &mdash; that is efficient. Where it lives in one senior person&rsquo;s head, adding hands multiplies the number of people asking that person questions, and the bottleneck gets worse rather than better.</p>
                  <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed text-foreground">In that situation a scoped project, or a cleanup engagement with a defined end, is usually the more honest first step. We would rather say so at the scoping call than three weeks into a season.</p>

              </div>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed">One note on terminology: firms searching for &ldquo;finance staff augmentation&rdquo; often want something broader than this. What we add is accounting capacity &mdash; bookkeeping, close work, payables and receivables, payroll preparation, tax preparation and audit preparation. We do not provide CFO, treasury or financial-advisory support in any form.</p>
