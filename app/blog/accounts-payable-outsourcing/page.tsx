      <p>AP problems usually start with the invoice pile — unprocessed bills, approval queues no one monitors, vendor statements unreconciled for months. By the time cash flow is affected, the backlog has been building for a while.</p>
      <p>Outsourcing AP solves the most consistent problem: no one is entering invoices, routing them, and reconciling vendor balances on a predictable schedule.</p>

      <h2>What the AP Team Handles vs. What Stays With You</h2>
      <p>
        The outsourced AP team handles the processing work — invoice entry, matching, routing, and reconciliation. Payment execution, vendor approval, and banking access stay with you; the AP team never initiates transfers or accesses your banking credentials. See our{' '}

      </p>

      <h2>The Invoice&rsquo;s Journey, From Inbox to Reconciled</h2>
      <p>Most AP proposals describe a service. What a firm actually needs to know is what happens to one invoice, and where it stops moving without a decision from someone on your side.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Arrival.</strong> The invoice lands in a dedicated payables address or is pulled from a vendor portal, and it is logged the day it arrives whether or not it is ready to code. Nothing sits unrecorded in an inbox.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation.</strong> Vendor, invoice number and amount are checked against what is already entered. This is the step that catches the duplicate &mdash; the same bill emailed twice, or a statement re-sent as an invoice.</li>
        <li><strong>Coding.</strong> GL account, department or class, entity, and tax treatment: input VAT in the UK, GST and ABN status in Australia, use tax and 1099 status in the US. Coded to your conventions, not to a generic chart.</li>
        <li><strong>Matching.</strong> Against a purchase order and receiving record where you use them; against the approved quote, contract or timesheet where you do not.</li>
        <li><strong>Routing.</strong> Sent to your named approver on your threshold rules. This is where the queue stops. Nobody outside your organisation approves anything.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment preparation.</strong> An approved batch is prepared in the platform and left ready. Your authorised person releases it from your bank.</li>
        <li><strong>Reconciliation.</strong> The AP subledger is tied to the GL control account and vendor statements are reconciled on a set day &mdash; the same day each month, so a variance has a known age rather than an unknown one.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Two of those seven steps need someone with authority in your organisation. The other five are the ones that consume a bookkeeper&rsquo;s week, and they are the ones that can be handed over.</p>

      <h2>Fraud Controls That Must Be in Place</h2>
      <p><strong>Duplicate invoice detection</strong> — checking vendor name, invoice number, and amount before entry — prevents the most common accidental overpayment. A <strong>restricted vendor master</strong> — new vendors added only by your internal team — prevents fake vendor fraud. Both should be documented in the onboarding agreement, not discovered missing after a payment error.</p>

      <h2>Three-Way Matching, and When It Is Overkill</h2>
      <p>A three-way match compares the purchase order, the receiving document and the vendor invoice before a bill is approved; quantities and prices have to agree across all three. It is the standard control where goods are physically ordered and received, and it is what stops a supplier being paid for forty units when thirty arrived.</p>
      <p>It also assumes you raise purchase orders. Plenty of practices, agencies and professional-services firms do not &mdash; the spend is subscriptions, subcontractors, rent and professional fees, and there is no receiving event to match against. Imposing a three-way match there produces a process everyone routes around within a quarter.</p>
      <p>The more useful question is not &ldquo;do we have three-way matching?&rdquo; but &ldquo;what is the second, independent piece of evidence?&rdquo; A contract or engagement letter, a signed-off timesheet, an approved quote, a delivery note. One invoice plus one independent confirmation is the control. Three documents is that same control, in the form businesses that buy goods need.</p>

      <h2>How It Works in Each Platform</h2>
      <p><strong>QuickBooks Online:</strong> Bills entered against vendor records. QBO lacks native multi-level approval, so invoice approval typically happens via email or a shared tracker before marking bills ready to pay in the Pay Bills queue. ACH/check initiation is by your authorized internal person, not the AP team.</p>
      <p><strong>Xero:</strong> Structured bills-to-pay module with built-in approval flow. Xero generates a batch payment file exported to your bank — the file, not the payment, comes from Xero. Hubdoc handles document capture and auto-publishes to Xero.</p>
      <p><strong>NetSuite:</strong> Multi-entity AP with SuiteFlow approval routing by vendor, amount, and subsidiary. EFT/ACH payment file generated; execution via your bank.</p>
      <p><strong>Sage 50 / Sage Intacct:</strong> Common in UK practice environments. Purchase ledger entry with role-based access controlling who posts vs. approves.</p>

      <h2>What an AP Team Needs Access To, and What It Must Never Have</h2>
      <p>This is usually the question behind the question, and it deserves a specific answer rather than a reassurance.</p>
      <p><strong>What the work requires:</strong> a named user in your accounting platform with permission to enter bills and run AP reports, access to the payables inbox, the vendor list, and your approval matrix so routing reaches the right person at the right threshold.</p>
      <p><strong>What it does not require, and what we do not ask for:</strong> your online banking credentials, payment release rights, the ability to add a vendor or edit a vendor&rsquo;s bank details, or authority to approve a bill. Creating a new vendor should stay with your internal team. A restricted vendor master is the single control that does most of the work against invoice fraud, and it only works if the people entering invoices cannot also create the payee.</p>
      <p>Where your platform supports role-based permissions &mdash; Xero, NetSuite, Sage Intacct and Sage 50 all do &mdash; those limits can be enforced in the software rather than agreed in an email. Ask for the permission set in writing during onboarding. A provider unwilling to work inside one has answered a different question.</p>

      <h2>Regional Nuances</h2>
      <p><strong>US:</strong> 1099 vendor tracking — unincorporated vendors need W-9s on file and 1099-NEC at year-end. Use tax on untaxed purchases. Three-way PO matching standard in businesses with purchase orders.</p>
      <p><strong>UK:</strong> Input VAT must be coded correctly for reclaim — errors create VAT return problems. Making Tax Digital requires digital records of all VAT transactions. CIS deduction from subcontractor payments in construction.</p>
      <p><strong>Australia:</strong> GST input tax credits coded per vendor ABN and GST registration status. RCTI arrangements (buyer creates the tax invoice) have specific ATO requirements.</p>

      <h2>What Does It Cost?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic entry and routing: $0.50–$1.50/invoice offshore</li>
        <li>Three-way PO matching: $1.50–$3.00/invoice</li>
        <li>Multi-entity: $2.00–$4.00/invoice</li>
        <li>Fixed monthly (200–500 invoices/month): $400–$1,500/month offshore</li>
        <li>Onshore equivalent: 50–65% more</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Tell in Month Three Whether It Is Working</h2>
      <p>An AP arrangement that is going wrong looks fine for about six weeks. The invoices get entered; the problems surface later, in the reconciliation and in the approver&rsquo;s inbox. Four signals show it early:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age of the oldest unposted invoice</strong> &mdash; not the average. Averages hide the one bill stuck for five weeks because nobody knew who owned it.</li>
        <li><strong>Share of invoices entered without a follow-up question.</strong> If that is not climbing month over month, the coding conventions have not transferred and the same question is being asked every cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Unreconciled vendor statement lines at month-end.</strong> A number that rises is a queue being processed faster than it is being tied out.</li>
        <li><strong>Time your approver spends per invoice.</strong> The point of delegating preparation is that review gets shorter. If approving takes as long as it used to, the preparation is not arriving in a reviewable state.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Agree those four at the start rather than after a bad month. They also give you the language for a corrective conversation that is about the process rather than about the people.</p>

      <h2>Real Questions</h2>
      <p><strong>&ldquo;What happens with the vendor inbox?&rdquo;</strong> Set up a dedicated ap@ address both your team and the AP team can access. Don&rsquo;t mix invoices into general inboxes.</p>
      <p><strong>&ldquo;How do they handle disputed invoices?&rdquo;</strong> Flag and escalate — not resolve. Dispute resolution is a commercial judgment that stays with you.</p>
      <p><strong>&ldquo;Can they handle multi-entity AP?&rdquo;</strong> Yes — invoice entry per entity, intercompany coding. Consolidation eliminations sit with your controller or CPA.</p>
