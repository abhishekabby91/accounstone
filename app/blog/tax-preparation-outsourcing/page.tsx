      <p>
        Tax return preparation outsourcing sits at a specific boundary: an offshore team can prepare returns, organize workpapers, and get everything e-filing ready — but the review, signing, and submission must be done by a licensed CPA, Enrolled Agent, or attorney. That boundary is not a technicality; it&rsquo;s regulatory under Circular 230 for US practitioners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practical use case for CPA firms is clear: the January-to-April volume spike doesn&rsquo;t justify hiring full-time staff who will be idle the other eight months. Offshore preparation support absorbs the surge while the licensed team focuses on review, client communication, and judgment-level decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>What Tax Preparation Outsourcing Includes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Return preparation and data entry from client source documents</li>
        <li>Workpaper organization and supporting schedule preparation</li>
        <li>Multi-state return preparation support</li>
        <li>Quarterly estimated tax calculations</li>
        <li>Prior-year data organization and software migration support</li>
        <li>E-filing-ready documentation prepared for licensed CPA/EA review</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Not included:</strong> Tax planning, tax strategy, advisory services, IRS representation, or signing and filing returns. Every return goes through licensed review before it leaves the firm. The preparation team handles data; the licensed professional handles judgment.
      </p>

      <h2>The IRS Representation Line</h2>
      <p>
        IRS representation — including holding Power of Attorney (Form 2848) on behalf of a taxpayer — requires being a licensed CPA, Enrolled Agent, or attorney under Circular 230. An outsourced preparation team that is not credentialed cannot represent clients before the IRS. Do not outsource representation. Preparation support that gets returns to e-filing ready — yes. POA, audit representation, or correspondence with the IRS — no.
      </p>

      <h2>Software: Drake Tax and CCH Axcess</h2>
      <p><strong>Drake Tax:</strong> Popular in US CPA firms for its speed and multi-state capabilities. An outsourced preparation team working in Drake Tax enters data from source documents, prepares federal and state returns, organizes workpapers, and queues returns for licensed review. The firm retains e-filing credentials and submission authority.</p>
      <p><strong>CCH Axcess:</strong> Wolters Kluwer&rsquo;s cloud-based tax and audit platform. Outsourced teams work within your firm&rsquo;s existing CCH Axcess access — preparation, document management, and review queue support. The firm controls system access and filing authority.</p>
      <p>Both platforms support remote access via the firms&rsquo; own access controls — the outsourced team works inside your firm&rsquo;s setup, not a separate environment.</p>

      <h2>Tax Season Capacity Planning</h2>
      <p>
        The most common error in tax season capacity planning is assuming the team that handles November work can absorb March without help. A CPA firm with 200 active clients and a February-to-April peak needs meaningfully more preparation capacity for those 10 weeks than for the rest of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The calculation that typically surfaces in onboarding conversations: if each return takes 3–5 hours of preparation time and a preparer can handle 8–10 returns per week, 200 returns filed in 10 weeks requires roughly 2–3 full-time equivalent preparers just for the work itself — before review time, client questions, or amended returns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Offshore preparation support can absorb the data-entry and initial-preparation stage of this work, letting licensed staff focus their hours on review — which is where the CPA&rsquo;s judgment and credentials actually matter.
      </p>

      <h2>UK and Australian Tax Preparation</h2>
      <p><strong>UK:</strong> Corporation Tax returns (CT600), Self-Assessment returns (SA100), VAT returns, and payroll RTI reconciliation are all preparable by offshore teams; the registered practitioner reviews and submits via HMRC online. Outsourced teams should not have HMRC portal credentials.</p>
      <p><strong>Australia:</strong> Income tax returns preparable by offshore teams working from the client&rsquo;s Xero or MYOB data; a registered tax agent reviews and lodges via the ATO&rsquo;s tax agent portal. BAS preparation likewise sits with the offshore team for preparation, registered BAS agent for lodgment. The offshore team should not have ATO portal access.</p>

      <h2>The §7216 Consent Most Firms Discover Late</h2>
      <p>
        This is the part of outsourcing tax return preparation that catches U.S. firms out, and it has
        nothing to do with quality of work. Before a return preparer discloses return information to
        another preparer, <strong>Internal Revenue Code §7216</strong> and the regulations under it require
        the taxpayer&rsquo;s written consent, in a form that meets the requirements of Rev. Proc. 2013-14.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not a formality to tidy up afterwards. §7216 is a criminal provision, and the consent has to
        be obtained <em>before</em> the disclosure rather than after it. Two details catch firms out in
        particular. A consent has to state that the return information may go to a preparer located
        outside the United States, where that is the case &mdash; a generic consent does not cover it. And
        there are specific conditions attached to disclosing a client&rsquo;s Social Security number to a
        preparer outside the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obligation sits with your firm, not with the provider, and the consent language is yours to
        adopt with your own counsel. What a provider can reasonably do is work to whatever process you put
        in place: masked identifiers, a defined client list, the folder structure your engagement letters
        already describe. If a provider tells you this step is unnecessary, that answer tells you
        something.
      </p>

      <h2>What the Workflow Actually Looks Like, Return by Return</h2>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Outsourced tax preparation&rdquo; describes a sequence, not a handover. On a working
        engagement it runs roughly like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Intake.</strong> Source documents, the organiser and the prior-year file arrive through
          your systems. Nothing is re-keyed into a separate platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Missing information raised first.</strong> Gaps are listed before preparation starts, not
          discovered halfway through. This is the step that most often decides whether a return comes back
          once or three times.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Preparation.</strong> Data entry into your tax software, book-to-tax adjustments worked
          through, and the supporting schedules built to your firm&rsquo;s format rather than the
          preparer&rsquo;s.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-review against your checklist.</strong> The preparer works the firm&rsquo;s own
          review checklist before the file moves, so the reviewer is not the first person to run it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Open questions written down where the reviewer will see them.</strong> Not buried in a
          separate email thread.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Review, signature, e-file.</strong> By your licensed CPA or Enrolled Agent. This step
          does not move, in any arrangement.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The useful question to ask a provider is not how many returns they can take. It is what step 2 and
        step 4 look like in practice, because those are the two that decide how much of your reviewer&rsquo;s
        time the arrangement actually gives back.
      </p>

      <h2>Entity Returns, Not Just 1040s</h2>
      <p>
        Most searches for outsourced tax preparation picture individual returns, but the entity work is
        usually where the hours are. Partnership returns on Form 1065 carry the K-1 detail behind them;
        1120 and 1120-S bring the book-to-tax reconciliation with them; and multi-state preparation is
        practical wherever the apportionment data already exists in the books.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where it exists is the operative phrase. An entity return is harder to delegate than a 1040 not
        because the form is harder, but because it depends on the quality of the underlying bookkeeping. If
        the trial balance is not clean, preparation stalls at the same point every time, and the honest
        first step is a{' '}
        <Link href="/services/bookkeeping/united-states">cleanup engagement</Link> rather than a
        preparation one.
      </p>

      <h2>What It Costs, and Why a Per-Return Price Can Mislead</h2>
      <p>
        Three pricing models are common: per return, hourly, and dedicated capacity booked for the season.
        Each is defensible, and each hides a different thing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Per return</strong> is easy to compare and easy to game. The number only means something
          alongside a definition of what counts as one return, what happens when a return turns out to need
          book cleanup first, and how many review rounds are included.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hourly</strong> is honest about complexity but gives you no ceiling, which is
          uncomfortable in the one season where you cannot afford a surprise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dedicated capacity</strong> books people rather than output. It suits a firm with a
          predictable volume and stops suiting one whose volume is lumpy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What actually moves the number is rarely the form type. It is the state of the source documents,
        how much of the bookkeeping has to be fixed before preparation can start, and how many times a file
        comes back. A low per-return price on a file that needs cleanup first is not a low price. Our{' '}
        <Link href="/resources/guides/outsourced-bookkeeping-cost-guide">cost guide</Link> works through
        the same logic for recurring bookkeeping.
      </p>

      <h2>Five Questions Worth Asking Before Busy Season</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Which tax software, and whose licence seats?</strong> If a provider needs seats your firm
          has to buy, that is a real cost and better known in November than February.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What happens when a return needs book cleanup first?</strong> A provider without an
          answer will simply stop, and you will find out during the week you can least afford it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What is your §7216 consent process?</strong> Not whether they have one &mdash; it is your
          obligation &mdash; but whether they know what you are asking about.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What happens if a preparer leaves mid-season?</strong> The answer should involve
          documented conventions and an overlap, not a name.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How is review feedback carried into the next file?</strong> If a correction has to be
          explained twice, the arrangement is costing you review time rather than saving it.
        </li>
      </ol>
