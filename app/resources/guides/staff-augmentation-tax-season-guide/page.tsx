      <p>
        A busy tax season creates a particular problem for accounting firms: the work arrives faster than the team can comfortably process it, but the extra capacity may not be needed at the same level once the deadline pressure passes.
      </p>

      <p>
        That does not automatically mean a firm should hire seasonal employees or outsource everything. A better starting point is to identify which parts of the workflow are consuming professional staff time and which parts can be prepared by additional support under the firm's review process.
      </p>

      <h2>Start With the Bottleneck, Not the Headcount</h2>
      <p>
        Ask where work is actually waiting. Is the problem document collection? Bookkeeping cleanup? Data entry? Return preparation assistance? Working-paper preparation? Or is the bottleneck the CPA's final review?
      </p>
      <p>
        If the bottleneck is final professional review, adding more preparation capacity may help only if it reduces the amount of unfinished work reaching the reviewer. If the review process itself is the constraint, the firm needs to address that separately.
      </p>

      <h2>What Can Often Be Delegated?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>PBC document organisation and follow-up</li>
        <li>Bookkeeping and transaction-level cleanup</li>
        <li>Reconciliation preparation</li>
        <li>Working-paper and schedule preparation</li>
        <li>Defined tax-return preparation assistance under the firm's review process</li>
        <li>Administrative workflow tracking and open-item follow-up</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The exact scope should be agreed before work begins. The fact that a task can be delegated does not mean it should be delegated without documentation, review standards and clear ownership.
      </p>

      <h2>What Should Stay With the CPA or Responsible Professional?</h2>
      <p>
        The firm's professional judgement, final review, client advice and responsibility for the final work product should remain with the appropriately responsible professionals. Support capacity should make that work easier, not blur who is accountable for the engagement.
      </p>

      <h2>US Firms: January Through Filing Deadlines Is Only Part of the Story</h2>
      <p>
        For U.S. firms, the early-year tax workload can create a sharp increase in preparation and review activity. But a firm may also have extensions, monthly bookkeeping, payroll-related work and other client deadlines running alongside tax preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means the useful question is often not “How do we survive January to April?” but “Which recurring workflow keeps taking our experienced people away from review and client work when volume rises?”
      </p>

      <h2>UK Firms: Think About the Actual Filing Calendar</h2>
      <p>
        UK firms should plan capacity around the deadlines and client mix they actually serve rather than copying the U.S. January-to-April model. Self Assessment work, Corporation Tax, VAT-related work, year-end accounts and recurring bookkeeping can create different peaks for different practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the same team handles bookkeeping and year-end or tax work, moving routine preparation work away from the busiest people can sometimes be more useful than simply adding people to the whole firm.
      </p>

      <h2>Australian Firms: EOFY Is Not the Only Capacity Question</h2>
      <p>
        Australian practices may see particular pressure around the end of the financial year, BAS-related work and tax-agent workflows, but the right capacity plan depends on the clients and services the firm handles.
      </p>
      <p>
        A firm that is already carrying a large monthly bookkeeping workload may need support well before the busiest tax deadlines arrive. The goal is to avoid entering the peak period with unresolved reconciliations and incomplete client records.
      </p>

      <h2>“Will I Spend More Time Reviewing Outsourced Work?”</h2>
      <p>
        This is one of the most reasonable questions a CPA partner can ask. If the additional work arrives incomplete, poorly documented or inconsistent with the firm's process, the answer can be yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practical way to reduce that risk is to define the expected output before the first task is assigned: file conventions, reconciliation standards, supporting documentation, review notes, escalation rules and the point at which work is considered ready for the firm's review.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Start Without Changing the Whole Firm</h2>
      <p>
        Start with one repeatable workflow. For example, a defined bookkeeping cleanup queue or a specific preparation task. Document what “ready for review” means, give the supporting team access only to what it needs, and review the first few cycles closely. Once the handoff is predictable, the scope can be expanded.
      </p>

      <h2>What About Seasonal Hiring?</h2>
      <p>
        Seasonal hiring can still be appropriate for some firms. The comparison should not be “outsourcing is always better.” Consider the time required to recruit, train and manage someone, how long the extra capacity is actually needed, and whether the person can become productive quickly enough to help with the current workload.
